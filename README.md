# Daily Notes — Minimal daily blog

This repository contains a small, static website for "Daily Notes": a minimalist daily-blog template focused on short essays, notes, and prompts.

Getting started

- Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site locally.

Files

- `index.html` — main HTML layout for the blog.
- `style.css` — minimalist, responsive styles for the site.

How to customize

- Replace placeholder posts in `index.html` with your content or integrate with a static site generator.
- Swap the avatar image in the sidebar with your own image.
- Update colors and spacing in `style.css` variables at the top of the file.

Notes

- This project is intentionally lightweight and dependency-free. It is suitable for quick prototypes or hosting on any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.).
